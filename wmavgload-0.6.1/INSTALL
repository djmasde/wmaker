wmavgload v 0.6.1

runs on sparc solaris and ix86 linux. Does it run on other platforms ??

1. Check the Imakefile to see if all the LIBS are ok for your system.
   ALSO, check DESTDIR and BINDIR; as they are now, a `make install'
   will put the wmload binary in /usr/local/bin.
   
   Check the LOCAL_LIBS line.

   If your compiler does not define 'linux' and you want to compile on linux
   please add -Dlinux in the Imakefile where you're told to do so !

2. If you encounters problems with colors (on 8bbp displays especialy), 
   remove -DMANY_COLORS in Imakefile

3. `xmkmf'

4. `make'

5. `make install'

6. Enjoy!!!! (;-)

7. send me an e-mail if you wish to see any improvements ...
