Installation instructions for WMTime.

Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing particular, but a computer might come in handy doh ;-)


Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------
1)  % tar -zxvf wmtime-1.0.tar.gz
2)  % cd wmtime.app/wmtime
3)* Optional, make a symlink to your preffered language like:
    % rm language
    % ln -s languages/slovene.lang language
4)* xmkmf -a (for *BSD systems needed only!).    
5)  % make
6)  copy 'wmtime' somewhere in your $PATH like /usr/local/bin;
7)  % wmtime & (or wmtime -h for help)


3)* The default language is US/English, WMTime currently only
    supports the US/English, Dutch and Slovenia languages.
    
    A locale version of your language is very simple to create,
    just take a look at the supplied '.lang' files in the 
    wmtime.app/wmtime/languages/ directory.

    If you do create one, please be so kind to mail it to us,
    this way we can include it with future releases of WMTime.
    
4)* This Imakefile was kindly donated by Pascal Hofstede but
    untested by the authors because we don't have a *BSD box
    to test and try it out... we're working on generic 
    Imakefiles though ;-)
           
Be sure to read the HINTS and TODO files too!
