wmWAVE 
Homepage: http://wmwave.sourceforge.net

wmwave is dockapp for window maker to display statistical information
about a current wirless ethernet connection.

Installation:
=============

Unzip the the distribution  

	tar xvfz wmwave-0-4.tgz

Change directories

	cd wmwave

Say

	make

and then install the program and manpage by

	make install


Running wmwave:
===============

To run wmwave simply type

	wmwave

Use the command line option '-r <time in milliseconds>' to control the
frequency of sampling of the processes. Use -display and -geometry
options in the usual way.



Troubleshooting:
================

wmwave was tested with Redhat 5.2 on Intel architecture machine
with a /proc filesystem, and a wavelan Sliver WEP IEEE ethernet
card. The kernel needs to support radio networking.  


If wmwave doesn't run,  make sure that

1) the kernel supports radio networking

	if not recompile your kernel with
	
		cd /usr/src/linux
		make xconfig
		
	select radio networking and follow the instructions
	in /usr/src/linux/README.
		
2) the wirless ethernet card and its driver is correctly installed
