Some translations are based on previous translations by other people.
The history of translations can be found in the po files.

Notes
-----
1. Multibyte character support must be enabled in WindowMaker. 

2. WindowMaker must also be started from a terminal program that can
display the messages in that language, like xterm that supports Korean
characters.

3. Uses iso8859-2 character set.



If you want to translate WindowMaker messages to some other language:
1 - type make WindowMaker.pot 
2 - translate WindowMaker.pot like:

msgid "%s aborted.\n"
msgstr "%s abortado.\n"

where msgid is the original message and msgstr is the translated
message. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH THE msgid LINES.

The info pages for gettext has more detailed information on how to
do translations. 

3 - (maintainer only) put the locale name in configure.in, in the list of
    supported locales

Then rename the WindowMake.pot file to the language code 
with a .po extension, reconfigure WindowMaker and run
make install.

To update an already translated message file use the tupdate command. As in:
tupdate WindowMaker.pot pt.po > pt.po.new


Notes: 
- if you think an error message is too obscure just ask me about it.
- you don't need to translate every single word. Some words/expressions are
	easier to understand in the original English form than in our 
	native languages. 
- some strings used in dialog panels and other GUI parts are limited by
the size of the widget. Unfortunately, the only way to verify that is by 
trial and error. 
- you can use characters other than standard ASCII, if needed. Keep in mind 
that if error messages that are output to stdout (instead of in a GUI dialog)
is translated using some character set different than ASCII, it will require
that the terminal from where wmaker is launched be able to display such 
characters. For example, if you translate _all_ messages to greek, you'll 
need to run wmaker from a xterm that can display greek.
- if you update a translation of someone else, please contact the current
maintainer, so that we don't have duplicate work. Also put a "history" log in
the top of the file, like:
#
#  Portuguese Message Catalog
#
#  Version	Maintainer
#  Original	Joe Shmoe
#  0.17.5	Joao da Silva
#

You may also want to translate the menu definition file.
Send the translated files to me, so that I can include them
in the next distribution.
