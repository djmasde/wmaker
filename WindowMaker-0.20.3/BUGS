- the app menu does not update after a style/theme change without restart.
- during startup, transient windows should be miniaturized with their owners
  not in their own icons
- stacking code is buggy (or XFree is buggy)
- WINGs has problems in some platforms (SGI, Sun etc.) Anyone on these
systems want to fix it?
- save session doesnt work on some platforms (Alpha and Sparc)
- texture pixmaps are being incorrectly freed somewhere. Either
fix bug (to support broken MetroX servers) or remove all useless references
to the Pixmap (to save memory and drop bug compatibility).
- host information is not saved/honored by the dock or save session stuff.
It should at least check if the host is the local machine and only save it
in the session/allow docking it if yes.
- the SHELL environment variable support in the apps menu was removed
because of a problem with tcsh. If ~/.tcshrc contains "stty erase ^H",
it will block and the cmd will not be executed. 
- mouse grab being done in client window (in wWindowResetMouseGrabs())
instead of the frame window. If grab is done in frame, titlebar buttons
dont work well
