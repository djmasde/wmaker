I don't remember everything, but here it goes:

- fixed some bugs in text field
- added a incomplete implementation of split view (not yet usable)
- added a slider
- changed the filepanel stuff. Each application can have only 1 file panel.
The same panel will be reused every time you call for it, unless you free it.

  font can't be loaded

- added function for user specified item height in WMList
- added WMSetPopUpButtonText(). It will set the default text in the button
  when no options are selected

  not good practice to change the contents of a popup button when it's
  already visible and the user has probably interacted with it.

  program
