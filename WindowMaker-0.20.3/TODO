Do ASAP:
========
- fix bestvisual selection code. Broken.
- add a dialog to let user choose if we should restart, restart twm or continue crashing on crash. Do not forget to check if wmaker is already fully running.
- fix stacking. buggy again (maybe XFree 3.2 bug)
- fix RemakeStackList() to account for transient windows
- differential update of appmenu
- make unhide app map windows in the same stacking order they were before
hiding
- blink border of clients with UrgencyHint set between red and black
- finish session stuff
- order window list menu by workspace

Need to do:
===========
- fix and include the windoze cycle window patch
- support for X11R6.4 extension for getting extra visual info in wrlib's
  automatic best context guessing
- rewrite menu traversal code
- docklet to control AccessX (keyboard accessibility) functions
- rewrite all redundant stuff to use WINGs
- resizebartexture option
- add function to directly make a thumbnail of an image, using the
  functionality provided by the image libraries to load a minimal
  amount of data.
+ investigate memory leaks 
- make Docked apps with WM_CLIENT_MACHINE be launched from respective
	machines (also put a marking showing it's remote launched)
- rewrite defaults/wdefaults stuff to use WINGs UD stuff. Search list:
  ~/G/D/WindowMaker /u/l/s/W/D/WindowMaker built-in-defaults
- remake internal string processing to use wchar? unicode?
- -stateprefix cmd arg to specify sufix for WMState domain (multiple instance
	support)
- GNOME stuff
- add new file for stuff like default commands and dnd commands for
docked apps, balloons for the dock etc
- alpha-channel app specified icons 

Maybe some day:
===============
- virtual workspace
- optimize for size
- make dithering in 8bpp better


Never: (so, dont even bother to ask)
======
- different themes for each workspace. Unless you give us a SGI/Power Onyx
with 2 CPUs ;). Different workspacebacks for each workspace is being
considered, but don't hold your breath.
- anything that requires the mouse pointer to be jumped by WindowMaker to
somewhere. This is *terrible* behaviour. And it's not just IMO.


- ICCCM 2.0: ICCCM 2.0 (not 1.0, which is what everybody supports so so) is
a relatively new standard and nobody, AFAIK, complies with it (not even
twm as people tend to think). It has some neat things, but many of the new
stuff is really weird and tricky to implement, not to say unworthy (read the
specs and you'll see). This is not bad, since I think it is very unlikely
that a client that requires it exists... Anyway, if we get an "official"
sample implementation (twm?) it might be supported. Maybe dtwm supports
it? I dont know...
