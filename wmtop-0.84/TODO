* Sort out the CHANGES file which is a mess right now.

* Make it use less CPU time.

* Port to IRIX.  I know how to do this but it means using the
  computers at work...

* Port to SunOS. Need to find a suitable volunteer to help!

* More safety checks (eg. around mallocs) and get rid of some of
  those fixed length arrays.

* Make a gnome applet version.
