* It's still occasionally bombing out under FreeBSD.

* I've had the colour of the bars go funny on me. I'm inclined to
  blame this on X rather than my code. I've seen other dockapps to
  this too.

* Under FreeBSD /proc seems to be updated at a low sample rate so
  the bars can be a bit misleading with processes fluctuating
  between 0% and 100%. It still gives a correct overall idea of
  what's using CPU.

* A process that appears and disappears between samples will never
  show up. I don't anticipate this ever getting fixed.
