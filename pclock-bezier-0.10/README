pclock v0.10
------------

pclock is a simple analog clock program designed to run under the
WindowMaker window manager. Any 64x64 pixmap may be used as a background,
including tiles.

One current limitation is that the clock hands are drawn within the mask of
the background XPM file. This will be fixed soon.

To build:
  edit src/Makefile
  make

Use ``pclock --help'' for instructions.

This program has only been tested with Linux and WindowMaker.
