oclock.xpm       - I used to ``fake'' a clock by putting an oclock window over
                   an empty tile. This is what it looked like.

round-3d.xpm     - The default background, which I raytraced.

square.xpm       - A simple square clock that fits in better with programs
                   like wmavgload, etc.

time-icon.xpm    - From a NeXTStep icon.

totd-05-24.xpm   - Tile of the Day, May 24th.

ugly-yellow.xpm  - An asymmetric background.

will-return.xpm  - Edited from a preview at http://www.photodisc.com/.

wmaker-tile.xpm  - A plain WindowMaker tile.

wood-tile.xpm    - From http://themes.org/, by Michael Barnes <mibarnes@vt.edu>

    Much of the X code was written by looking at the many other WindowMaker
    dock apps out there.
