Do ASAP:
========
- change Revert in attribs editor to Undo.
- WorkspaceSpecificClip option for the clip.
- add a dialog to let user choose if we should restart, restart twm or continue crashing on crash. Do not forget to check if wmaker is already fully running.
- replace handle_enternotify and handle_leavenotify with handle_anything
  in dock.c. Maybe adding a eventmask in WObjDescriptor for the events
  that should call handle_anything
- shared mem in wrlib
- shortcut for appmenu
- fix stacking. buggy again
+ ICCCM compliant stuff: find what is missing
	- WM_COLORMAP_NOTIFY clientmessage
- fix RemakeStackList() to account for transient windows
- change CommitStacking() on AddToStackingList() to more optimized thing
- differential update of appmenu
- make unhide app map windows in the same stacking order they were before
hiding

Need to do:
===========
- add function to directly make a thumbnail of an image, using the
  functionality provided by the image libraries to load a minimal
  amount of data.
- clickonclientarearaisewindow
- option for different icon box position
- GNUstepWMAttributes update in propertynotify
+ investigate memory leaks 
- rewrite colormap stuff
- make Docked apps with WM_CLIENT_MACHINE be launched from respective
	machines (also put a marking showing it's remote launched)
- handle change of CLIENT_LEADER property
- fix the sleeping code in wNextEvent() in event.c to work correctly.
  For the moment it can block timer events until an X event occurs in some
  cases.

Maybe some day:
===============
- configurator (external program)
- virtual desktop
- optimize for size
- multiple screen support
- make dithering in 8bpp better
