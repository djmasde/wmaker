   WINGs is a small widget set with the N*XTSTEP look and feel. It's API
is inspired in OpenStep and it's implementation borrows some ideas
from Tk. It has a reasonable set of widgets, sufficient for building
small applications (like a CDPlayer or hacking something like rxvt).

   The library is limited and it's design is a little sloppy, 
so it's not intended to build large or complex applications, like 
Word Processors although I think it would not be impossible to do that. 
GNUstep should be used for such applications.

   Since WINGs is written in C and is sort of low-level it is small
and faster than say, Motif or even Athena. Knowing Xlib will help you to 
workaround some of it's limitations, although you'll probably be able to 
write something like a trivial tic-tac-toe game without knowing much Xlib.

   Some of it's functions are designed to support the WindowMaker window
manager (see http://windowmaker.org) but WindowMaker is not required to use
applications written with WINGs. You can probably use such apps with
any other window manager.
