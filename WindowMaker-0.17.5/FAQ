- General Information.

	There is a mailing list for discussing WindowMaker. To subscribe, 
	send a message containing the word subscribe to 
	wmaker-request@eosys.com

	If you have some bug report, please send me a detailed description
	of the bug and some information about your system (OS, X server,
	WindowMaker version etc.). In the util directory, there is a
	script called bughint that gathers information about your system. 
	Run it from a xterm and send the output file to me.
	Unclear bug reports are quite useless and most likely to be ignored.
	Please note that although I'm open to suggestions, it doens't mean
	I will implement it. There are a lot of other things I have to do.
	If you want some feature, try coding it yourself and send me a patch.
	You can reach me at kojima@windowmaker.org

- I18N support does not work. 
	Check these:
	- the LANG environment variable is set to your locale, and 
	  the locale is supported by your OS's locale or X's locale
	  emulation. you can display all supported locales by 
	  executing "locale -a" command if it available. and you
	  can check if your locale is supported by X's locale emulation.
	  See "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/locale.alias"

	- if your OS doesn't support any locale or if your OS doesn't 
 	  support a locale for your language, you can use X Window System's
	  locale emulation feature instead of OS's locale. To use this
	  feature, add this option to the configure, "--with-x-locale".
	  if your OS is commercial one, such as Solaris,IRIX,AIX,...,
	  you perhaps don't have to use X's locale emulation.
	  But if your OS is Linux or NetBSD or .. , it's possible
	  your locale is not supported so far. then use "--with-x-locale".

	  Note: to use X's locale emulation, your Xlib has to be
	        compiled so that the locale emulation is enabled.
	        Linux RedHat5.0's default Xlib is not compiled 
		like that. (RH4.x are ok). Recompiled Xlib for
		RH5.0 where you can use locale emulation is available
		here:
		ftp://ftp.linux.or.jp/pub/RPM/glibc

	- if you'd like to display multibyte characters, wmaker have to
	  be compiled with multibyte character support. Add this option
	  to the configure, "--enable-kanji".

	- the fonts you're using support your locale. if your font
	  setting on $HOME/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker is like..

	  WindowTitleFont = "-*-helvetica-bold-r-normal-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*";
	  MenuTitleFont = "-*-helvetica-bold-r-normal-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*";
	  ......................................................

	  then you can't display non iso8859-x charcters by helvetica. 
	  so quick way to display various languages' font is to change
	  all the font settings into:
	  
		"-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

	  and also you need to change font settings in style files in
	  the "$HOME/Library/WindowMaker/Style" directory.

	- the LC_CTYPE environment variable is unset or it has the correct
          value. If you don't know what is the correct value, unset it.

- Netscape is not refreshed correctly. 
	This problem is not specific to WindowMaker. I noted this problem
	with AfterStep, fvwm2 and olwm. It's probably something with Netscape
	or XFree86. Note that this only happens when a menu or icon is
	laying over the affected window. 
Fix:
	- Don't place menus over Netscape. 
	- Turn UseSaveUnders off.

- Why some apps, like Netscape, can't be docked like others? 
	WindowMaker relies on some window properties in the apps.
	These tell what windows belong to a single instance of an
	app, how the app must be started (the command line) and 
	the application specific identification of the type of
	window (class and instance). You can see if these are supported
	by the application by running xprop on the window. The following
	properties must appear:
	* WM_CLASS(STRING):

	* WM_CLIENT_LEADER(WINDOW):
		OR
	  WM_HINTS(WM_HINTS):
		window id # of group leader:

	* WM_COMMAND(STRING):

	Some applications, like the Gimp don't have enough information
even for assigning icons.

- How do I dock asclock?
	1. build the included asclock
	2. run asclock -shape
	3. drag asclock to the dock and drop it when a white shadow appears
	4. double click on the back of the asclock icon with the 3rd mouse 
		button. A little dot will appear on the top-right corner.

- What are the bullet-hole icons?
	They are default icons used for applications that don't have any
assigned to them. Check the User Guide for information on how to
assign icons to applications and windows. If you already did and still
get these icons, make sure that the icons you have are accessible to
WindowMaker. The PixmapPath option in $HOME/GNUstep/WindowMaker must 
include the path where the icon resides. 


- When I dock asclock, wmload or whatever and restart a bullet-hole 
icon appears.
	Double click on the icon with the right mouse button. A little
	dot should appear in the top-right corner.


- What are the 3 dots on the dock buttons?
	They indicate the app is not running. As soon as you
	double click on the button and launch the app, the
	dots will disappear.
	
- But they don't disappear when I launch xyz!!!
	The dots will not disappear for apps that can't be docked
	in the normal way. There's no reasonable way to fix this.

- Is there a ASCP like control panel for WindowMaker? When will it be done?
	There is no control panel for WindowMaker yet. I don't know when 
it will be done. 


- How do I swallow clock, xload etc.?
	You can't swallow things (WindowMaker is not fvwm or AfterStep).
	What you can do is dock some apps that have icon windows or
	animated icons, like the patched asclock.

- Function key bindings don't work

If your .xmodmap file has something like the above, comment out the
entries that redefine the function keys.


- How do I assign different icons to xterms?

You must run xterm as:

xterm -name <name> -e <command>

For example:

xterm -name pine -e pine

xterm -name foobar -e telnet foobar.com

xterm -name vi -e vi

Then, assign icons to the applications in 
$HOME/GNUstep/Defaults/WMWindowAttributes like:


pine.XTerm = { Icon = "mailbox.xpm"; };

foobar.XTerm = { Icon = "foobar.xpm"; };

vi.XTerm = { Icon = "editor.xpm"; };
