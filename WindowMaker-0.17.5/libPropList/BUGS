o gsdd dies if WindowMaker dies (i.e. segfaults). Why is that?

o Syntax errors in property-list files are still not handled too gracefully.  

o There is no hashing whatsoever; searching is done on strcmp / memcmp 
  basis. I don't know how to change this, though.


o in "defaults write", non-alphabetic characters get ignored during parsing
ex:
	defaults write abcd abc+def

o gsdd sends multiple repeated notifications for a single operation
