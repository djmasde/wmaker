SUPPORTED PLATFORMS 
===================
(eg: I've heard someone has compiled it on...)

- Intel/Linux (primary platform)
- Sparc/Linux RedHat 5.1
- PowerPC/MkLinux 
- Alpha/Linux RedHat 5.1
- FreeBSD
- Solaris 2.5.1, 2.5.2
- Solaris 2.6.0
- Solaris 2.7beta

Patches to make it work on other platforms are welcome.


REQUIREMENTS:
=============

The following software is required to use WindowMaker

- X11R6		
	WindowMaker can be compiled in older versions of X, like X11R5
	(Solaris) or X11R4 (OpenWindows) but it will not work 100% correctly.


OPTIONAL:
=========

These libraries are not required to make WindowMaker work, but they
are supported in case you want to use them.


- libXPM 4.7 
	Older versions may not work!!! 
	Available at ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/X/

	There is builtin support for XPM files, but it will not
	load images in some uncommon encodings.

- libpng 0.96 or newer and zlib     
	For PNG image support.

- libtiff 3.4 or newer
	For TIFF image support.
	You can get it at ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff

- libjpeg

Most of these can be get from ftp.uu.net/pub/graphics


CONFIGURE OPTIONS:
==================

These options can be passed to the configure script to enable/disable
some WindowMaker features. Example:

./configure --enable-kanji

will configure WindowMaker with kanji characters support compiled in.


--disable-xpm   disables use of the XPM library even if it is available on
	your system. 

--disable-png	disables use of PNG library

--disable-tiff 	disable use of TIFF library

--disable-jpeg 	disable use of JPEG library

--disable-shape  disables shaped windows (for oclock, xeyes etc.)

--enable-debug	adds extra debugging information. Do not use it
	unless you're debugging WindowMaker.
	
--enable-kanji	support to display Kanji characters, Korean, Chinese 
		and other languagues that require special characters.

--with-x-locale  uses X locale emulation instead of OS locale.

--enable-single-icon  enables the collapsing of all appicons of the
	 WM_CLASS+WM_INSTANCE into a single one. This feature is not 
	supported at all by the developers. If you have some trouble with it,
	contact it's author: Christopher Seawood <cls@seawood.org>


PLATFORM SPECIFIC NOTES:
========================
- SCO Unix - run configure like
	CFLAGS="-belf -DANSICPP" ./configure 

- SunOS, Solaris 
	If you have gcc installed, after running configure, edit
	src/config.h and change the #define CPP_PATH line to
	#define CPP_PATH "gcc -E -x c"
	Sun's cpp lacks some features needed by WindowMaker and it can
	cause problems when parsing the config files.

- RedHat Linux
	Make sure you don't have the LANG and LINGUAS environment variables
	 set to en_RN

- Debian Linux
	If you want JPEG and TIFF support, make sure you have libtiff-dev 
	and libjpeg-dev	installed.


INSTALLATION:
=============

Unpack WindowMaker-data.tar.gz and move the pixmaps directory in it
to /usr/local/share/pixmaps

You can get the file at ftp://ftp.windowmaker.org. This file is not strictly
necessary, but contains some additional nice icons and other things.


autoconf and automake
---------------------

autoconf and automake are not required, but if you have them installed,
make sure you have autoconf 2.12 and automake 1.3 or newer. If you have
an older version, disable them by temporarily renaming them to something 
else or uninstalling them from your system. 


Build libPropList
-----------------

Note: You only need to build libPropList if you don't have it installed 
in your system.

libPropList is included with the distribution, so you don't
need to download it anywhere (some people have asked me this...)
But if you already have libPropList installed on you system you
can skip this step, since configure will detect that and use the
installed version first if available.

To build libPropList, simply type the following at the shell prompt:

	gunzip -c libPropList.tar.gz | tar xf -
	cd libPropList
	./configure
	make

then, login as root and type:
	
	make install


Build WindowMaker
-----------------
	If this is the first time you're building WindowMaker, you can
simply type:

	./configure
	make

then, login as root and type:

	make install

or if you want to strip the binaries from debugging symbols and make them
smaller, you can instead type:

	make install-strip

This will build and install WindowMaker with default parameters.

If you want to customize some compile-time options, you can do the
following. 

	1. (optional) Look at the CONFIGURE OPTIONS section above for the 
options available. Also run:
 
	./configure --help

	to get a complete listing of other options that are available.

	2. Run configure with the options you want. For example, if you
	want to use the --enable-kanji option, type:

	./configure --enable-kanji

	3. (optional) Edit src/wconfig.h with your favorite text editor 
	and browse through it for some options you might want to change.

	4. Compile WindowMaker. Just type:

	make

	5. Login as root (if you can't do that, read the "I don't have the 
	root password :-(" section) and install WindowMaker in your system. 
	Again, type:
		su root
		make install

User specific configuration
---------------------------

These instructions do not need to be followed when upgrading WindowMaker
from an older version, unless stated differently in the NEWS file.

Every user on your system that wishes to run WindowMaker must do the
following:

	1. Install WindowMaker configuration files in your home directory.
Type:
	wmaker.inst

	wmaker.inst will install WindowMaker configuration files and will
setup X to automatically launch WindowMaker at startup.

	That's it! The configuration file where you can edit your preferences
is $HOME/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker. 
	The $HOME/GNUstep/Defaults/WMWindowAttributes file is where you assign
icons to applications and edit some other attributes for windows. This can
be also edited from the "Attributes Panel". To access it, click the titlebar
of the window with the Right mouse button and select "Attributes...".

	The $HOME/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/menu file is the definition of 
the root menu. Edit it according to the applications you have installed.

Read the User Guide for a more in depth explanation of WindowMaker.
The User Guide is avaiable at http://windowmaker.org

You might want to take a look at the FAQ too.


I don't have the root password :(
---------------------------------

If you can't get superuser privileges (can't be root) you can install
wmaker in your own home directory. For that, supply the --prefix option
when running configure in step 2 of building WindowMaker . Example:

./configure --enable-kanji --prefix=/home/jshmoe


Then make /home/jshmoe/bin be included in your search path and run 
bin/wmaker.inst


UPGRADING
=========

If you are upgrading from an older version of WindowMaker:

	1. Configure and build WindowMaker as always
	2. Install WindowMaker (but do not run wmaker.inst)
	3. Read the NEWS file and update your configuration files, 
	   if necessary.

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

== Error during build of libPropList

make: *** No rule to make target `libPropList.a.c', needed by 
`libPropList.a.o'.  Stop.

Make sure the autoconf and automake versions you have installed are at
least:
autoconf 2.12
automake 1.3

If you are using the RPM's that come with RedHat 4.x, don't use them.
It is broken. Uninstall the RPM and reinstall a fresh package from

You can get them from ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu or any mirror.

== configure doesn't detect libtiff, or other graphic libraries.

Delete config.cache, then rerun configure adding the following options to
configure (among the other options you use):
--with-gfx-libs="-L/usr/local/lib"
--with-gfx-incs="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include/tiff"
Put the paths where your graphic libs and their corresponding header files are
located. You can put multiple paths in any of these options, as the example
of --with-gfx-incs shows. Just put a space between them.


== configure doesn't detect libXpm. 

* Check if you have a symbolic link from libXpm.so.4.9 to libXpm.so


== Segmentation fault on startup

* Check if the version of libXPM you have is at least 4.7

* Check if you have an updated version of ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker

If you're not sure, try renaming ~/GNUstep to ~/GNUtmp and then run wmaker.inst

== "...: your machine is misconfigured. gethostname() returned (none)"

* the hostname of your machine is set to something invalid, that starts
	with a parenthesis. Do a man hostname for info about how to set it.


== Multibyte I18N doesn't work

* Try to rebuild wmaker with adding configure option, "--with-x-locale".
  See FAQ for more information.

* Try other things noted in the FAQ

== The root menu contains only 2 entries. ("XTerm" and "Exit...")

* WindowMaker is not finding cpp (the C preprocessor). If your cpp is
not located in /lib/cpp, edit src/config.h and correct the path in
CPP_PATH.


LOCALES
=======
WindowMaker has national language support. 
To enable national language support, you must compile
WindowMaker with some additional parameters. 

0 - You must have the GNU gettext package installed. It can be
obtained at ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gettext-nnn.tar.gz

(Usually, you can skip the rest if you use the build script)

1 - You have to select the languages you want to support. Set the
LINGUAS to the list of locales you want. English is always
suported. Example:

setenv LINGUAS "pt ja de"
in csh

or

export LINGUAS;LINGUAS="pt ja de"
in sh

The list of supported locales is:

pt	Portuguese
jp	Japanese
de	German
es	Spanish
se	Swedish
ko	Korean
cs	Czech
nl	Dutch
fr	French
gl	Galician
it	Italian

Besides English, which is the default language.

Contact me if you'd wish to translate and maintain locale files 
for other languages.


2 - Additionally, if your language uses multi-byte characters, such
as Japanese or Korean, you must edit src/wconfig.h and define I18N_MB.


3 - Configure, build and install WindowMaker normally.


To select a particular locale at runtime you must set the LANG environment
variable to the locale you want. For example, if you want to
set the portuguese locale, you must run

setenv LANG pt

in csh or

export LANG; LANG=pt

in Bourne sh and similars

Note: If you have the LC_CTYPE environment variable set, you must
unset it before running wmaker.

For menu definition files, WindowMaker searches for them in the
following order (for brazilian portuguese, in this case):

menu.pt_BR
menu.pt
menu
