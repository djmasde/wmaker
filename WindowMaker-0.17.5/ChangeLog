  have caused hazardous (even crash) behavior if the pixmap image for texture
  was not found.
- Fixed code in session handling, to save only one entry for applications with
  multiple windows opened on screen.
- Implemented option to allow miniwindows to be workspace specific. It is named
  WorkspaceTiedMiniWindows = Yes/No; It is set in WindowMaker domain. Read NEWS

- Many fixes to moveres.c.
- Put all the keys from defaults.c in WindowMaker domain database. 
- Fixed a crashing bug when workspace names were as long (or longer) as
  MAX_WORKSPACENAME_WIDTH (16 characters). In this case a right click on a
  window title caused WindowMaker to crash.
- Included support for detecting if system requires to include libxpg4, which
  is needed by some FreeBSD systems, when using --enable-kanji.
- Some fixes to configure.in and some Makefile.am files to allow the use of

  be separate.

  badly configure launching child. Only for systems which have setpgrp().
  This is autodetected by configure, and used if available, else it will revert
  to old behavior.

  with click on title-bar. Meta click on titlebar will lower them.
- Fixes in moveres.c to allow a smoother draw of frames while moving and
  resizing windows.
- Fixed a problem when resizing with Meta+RightClick.
- Fixed a bug that freezed WindowMaker when dragging a window from one

  icons.
- Changing icons in WMWindowAttributes domain, now automatically reflect on
  screen, without the need of restarting WindowMaker.
