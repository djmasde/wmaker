Repo for "destroyed or abandoned" dockers of Window Maker

are two:

Wmwave: show wavelan connection aka wireless status, runs ok

wmtime.app: version of clock "wmdate" for wmaker, hacked to show Internet Time

"Swatch" and beats, re "hacked" to runs ok

Added Window Maker 0.17.5, runs ok, only changues, re formated Makefiles, and configure to actual format, install without problems :)

remember backup the GNUstep dir, if uses a never version of wmaker...

Installation:

In the wmaker dir:

$ cd WindowMaker-0.17.5

$ ./configure

$make

#make install

run this in root user with su o sudo commands

"optionally" # make uninstall before install this very old wmaker..

runs wmaker.inst script, and enjoy
